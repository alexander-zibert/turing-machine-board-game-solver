## Building

### CLI Build

Just run `make` in the root directory. Then you can run the binary `./a.out`.

### WASM Build

The WASM build requires a working [emscripten toolchain](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions-using-the-emsdk-recommended).

Afterwards, you can run `make wasm` to build.

### Frontend

Run `npm install` in the `frontend` directory. Then, you can run `npm run start` to build and serve the frontend on your local machine.

## Tests

Run `make doctest` in the root directory. Then you can run the binary `./test.out`.
